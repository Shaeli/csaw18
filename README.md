# CSAW'18: The Maple Cookie Army github - El√©onore Carpentier & Corentin Thomasset
**Maple Cookie Army for the win !**

üèÜ  EDIT: We did it! We won the European final of the Embedded security Challenge üèÜ 


[Winners](https://csaw.engineering.nyu.edu/esc/csaw18-winners)

### 2018 Challenge Description
>*Lean Enterprise Advanced Knowledge Solutions (LEAKS) is a private technology company that gets awarded most of the defense and military contracts of the country of IoTilandia. Given the sensitive nature of its contracts, LEAKS employs **a complete air-gap separation** for all its internal networks, ensuring no data is leaked through public connections.*

>*A recent presidential order requires that all IoTilandia companies, including LEAKS, "IoTize" [sic] their infrastructure by making everything smarter; coffee makers, fridges, chairs, and light bulbs. To abide to this presidential order, LEAKS has installed sophisticated smart light bulbs in their offices and connected them to their internal network.*

>*In the CSAW Embedded Systems Challenge 2018 (ESC18), you are tasked to exploit these newly installed smart light bulbs to exfiltrate IoTlandia secrets, **bridging the air-gapped networks** of LEAKS.*
